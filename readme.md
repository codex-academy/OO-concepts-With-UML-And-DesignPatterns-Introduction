## OO concepts

### Inheritance

In this example there are two examples of inheritance.

Inheritance from `Car` and from `Engine`.

### Polymorphism

The fact that a `Car` can have any `Engine` is an example of `Polymorphism`. As long as it's an `Engine` the `Car` class can be instantiated.

## UML

Use PlantUML to draw an UML diagram to vizualize the current setup.

* Learn more about creating UML class diagrams with PlantUML [here]( https://plantuml.com/class-diagram)
* Create UML diagrams (here)[http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml].

There are various different UML class relationships.

To name a few:

* Extension	    `<|--`		
* Aggregation	`o--`
* Composition	`*--`

Use `Extension` for inheritance - to show one class inherit from another. And `Aggregation` to show one class reference another.

Read the articale below when to use `Composition`.

## Interfaces & Abstract Classes

We will use this example to explore interfaces & Abstract classes as well.

## Design patterns

Go to this URL: https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns

Read through the list of Design Patterns. Pick one you found interesting

Once done share in Slack:

* Which pattern you selected
* What type of pattern it is
* And read the description of the pattern to the group
